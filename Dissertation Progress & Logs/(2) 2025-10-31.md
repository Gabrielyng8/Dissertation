## 🧠 Discussion Overview

This was the **second mentor meeting** focused on refining the *Statement of Intent (SOI)* and aligning it with academic and ethical expectations before submission (14 Nov 2025).  
The discussion centered on **broadening the project’s framing**, **clarifying its dual focus**, and ensuring that **only SOI-relevant work** is pursued at this stage.

## 💬 Mentor Feedback and Discussion Points

### 1. Stay Within SOI Scope ⚠️
- **Mentor’s Input:**  
  I must restrict current efforts to work directly related to the SOI.  
  Any prototype or technical development will be interpreted as “final project work,” which is premature.  
  The SOI should focus solely on the **conceptual proposal** — aims, significance, and methodology overview.

- **My Takeaway:**  
  Pause all implementation-related activity until the SOI is approved.  
  Focus only on theoretical framing, feasibility, and research justification.

---
### 2. Avoid a Single Line of Thought
- **Mentor’s Input:**  
  Avoid locking into one technical or conceptual approach too early (e.g., only YOLO or only OCR).  
  The SOI should reflect *exploration*, not *decision*.  

- **My Takeaway:**  
  I will present multiple potential solution paths for result identification and analysis — OCR, homography, and synthetic-trained YOLO — to show an open investigative mindset.

---
### 3. Project Significance: Calibration + Monitoring System
- **Mentor’s Input:**  
  Under “Significance,” describe the system as:
  > “A low-cost, accessible, and efficient system for the calibration and continuous monitoring of rotational mechanisms.”

- **My Takeaway:**  
  This phrasing captures both immediate calibration and long-term monitoring, framing the work as technically useful, inexpensive, and widely applicable.

---
### 4. Generalize the Application Domain
- **Mentor’s Input:**  
  At the SOI stage, avoid specifying *casino roulette*.  
  Instead, describe the research as applicable to **consumer-grade or mechanical wheel systems** (e.g., “spin-the-wheel” games).  
  Roulette may be mentioned only as a *representative use case*.

- **My Takeaway:**  
  This change removes legal and ethical complications and allows more flexibility in future experimentation.  
  I will phrase it as:  
  > “The system targets mechanical rotational devices that determine outcomes through physical motion — such as roulette-style wheels.”

---
### 5. Clarify the Two-Part Structure
- **Mentor’s Input:**  
  Clearly separate:
  1. **Computer Vision layer** – detection and outcome extraction  
  2. **Statistical layer** – analysis of detected outcomes for bias or drift over time  

- **My Takeaway:**  
  This dual structure should be stated explicitly in the SOI overview and objectives.

---
### 6. Ethics and “Business Harm” Precautions
- **Mentor’s Input:**  
  The ethics form should explicitly explain each answer.  
  Stress that:
  - No human participation is involved.  
  - No gambling or casino testing will occur.  
  - The project has no commercial or business motive.  
  - The technical solution is generic and educational.  

- **My Takeaway:**  
  I will include rationales such as:  
  > “This is a purely technical feasibility study with no connection to real gambling systems or business operations.”

---
### 7. Exploration of Result-Identification Methods
- **Mentor’s Input:**  
  - **OCR:** Possible but may face performance limits.  
  - **Homography:** Promising for stable geometric mapping.  
  - **Synthetic dataset:** Use diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) to generate training data for pocket numbers at various angles/lighting.  

- **My Takeaway:**  
  I will list all three as candidate methods in the SOI but reserve in-depth comparison for the dissertation stage.

---
### 8. Physical Wheel Use and Experimental Focus
- **Mentor’s Input:**  
  Using a physical roulette wheel remains valuable for later experimentation.  
  It allows bias simulation (tilt, weights) and practical testing once project work officially begins.

- **My Takeaway:**  
  I will mention the potential of physical hardware **only as a future research asset**, not as current work.

## 🧱 Agreed Next Steps

|#|Action|Description|
|---|---|---|
|1|**Refine Significance section**|Describe the system as low-cost, accessible, and dual-purpose (calibration + monitoring).|
|2|**Generalize scope**|Replace casino references with “rotational game or mechanical outcome systems.”|
|3|**Clarify structure**|Emphasize CV + Statistics as the two research pillars.|
|4|**Enhance ethics answers**|Add explicit justifications for each question, especially around business harm and gambling neutrality.|
|5|**List multiple approaches**|Outline OCR, homography, and synthetic YOLO without committing to one.|
|6|**Revise literature review**|Keep roulette references but reframe them as the most documented example of rotational systems.|
|7|**Prepare SOI for submission**|Complete by **14 Nov 2025**, focusing on research area, questions, and hypothesis (title not binding).|

## 🧩 Overall Reflection

This meeting shifted the focus from a *roulette-specific tool* to a *generalized rotational calibration and monitoring framework*.  
It clarified what parts of the SOI are binding, reduced ethical risk, and ensured my proposal remains open, exploratory, and research-driven.

> **Revised Identity:**  
> A *Computer-Vision and Statistical Framework* for the calibration and ongoing monitoring of mechanical rotational systems, emphasizing low cost, accessibility, and general applicability.

## 🗣️ Next Meeting Talking Points

- Review finalized SOI draft (significance, ethics, research questions).  
- Discuss framing examples for “rotational systems” (roulette-style, spin-the-wheel, etc.).  
- Outline data-generation plan (synthetic vs physical capture).  
- Confirm submission checklist for **14 Nov 2025**.
