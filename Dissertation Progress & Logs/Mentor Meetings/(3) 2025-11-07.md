## ✅ Overview

This meeting finalised the refinement of the SOI and officially shifted the project focus from _proposal writing_ to _building early prototypes_. We discussed synthetic datasets, template matching vs YOLO, and potential experimental directions for the digit-detection component of the system.

---
## 1. **SOI Completion & Updated Purpose of Study**

- Concluded the refinement of the SOI.
- New framing emphasises:
    - The system is **not limited to professional casino wheels**.
    - The study aims to create a **lightweight, accessible way to monitor game-wheel physics**.
    - The project applies broadly to **physical rotational systems**, not just roulette.
- Mentor is satisfied with the new focus & direction.

---
## 2. **Project Direction: From SOI → Prototyping**

- Shifted into the **experimental prototyping stage**.
- Next steps involve testing actual techniques for:
    - Number detection
    - Wheel calibration & geometry estimation
    - Monitoring drift
- Mentor encouraged **trying multiple approaches**, not committing to one early.

---
## 3. **Synthetic Dataset Discussion**

Mentor recently experimented with a synthetic dataset in his own project and obtained strong results. This triggered a discussion about whether **synthetic data could help train a number detector** for the wheel.

### 3.1 Tasks for Me

- Research techniques to:
    - Create **small tile datasets** (one tile per number)
    - Train models that have to detect these tiles **in context** (on a wheel)
- Evaluate image generation options:
    - **Stable Diffusion 2**
    - **Flux**
    - HuggingFace text-to-image models

### 3.2 Mentor’s Concerns

- **Resolution** of generated images may be too low for small targets (tiny numbers on a wheel).
- YOLO might struggle if:
    - Training images only contain isolated numbers.
    - Testing happens on full wheel images (different context, lighting, rotation).

---
## 4. **Can YOLO Replace Template Matching?**

We explored whether YOLO could be trained like a template matcher by using only synthetic close-ups of the numbers (0–36) with bounding boxes covering the whole image.

Mentor asked ChatGPT during the meeting:

> **“Can YOLO be used in a template-matching fashion with a dataset consisting only of number crops?”**

### Summary of ChatGPT’s Answer

|Approach|Works With Dataset of Only Isolated Numbers?|Handles rotation/scale?|Suitability|
|---|---|---|---|
|**YOLO directly**|❌ No|❌ No|Not recommended|
|**Template Matching (OpenCV)**|✅ Yes|⚠️ Needs rotation variants|Good for static + consistent patterns|
|**Synthetic YOLO Training (generated contexts)**|✅ Yes|✅ Yes|⭐ Best long-term approach|
|**Hybrid (synthetic templating)**|✅ Yes|⚠️/✅ depending on implementation|Possible approach|

### Why YOLO alone will not work

- YOLO **learns contextual features** and needs examples of numbers **in the wheel environment**.
- Isolated crops → YOLO learns a “digit classifier” but not a detector.

## 5. **Template Matching vs YOLO**

### Advantages of Template Matching

- Lightweight
- No ML model required
- Good if:
    - Lighting is stable
    - Numbers are consistent across wheels
    - Rotation/angle variations are handled

### Disadvantages

- Extremely brittle  
    Small changes break it:
    - Lighting
    - Blur
    - Rotation
    - Perspective distortion
    - Different font or size

### Mentor’s Insight

> “Template matching may cause headaches because it isn’t intelligent — any unseen variation might break it.”

### Possible Practical Use

- Use template matching specifically for the **‘0’ pocket**:
    - Rarely appears
    - Always green background
    - Easier segmentation

---
## 6. **Synthetic YOLO Dataset Possibility**

If I generate synthetic close-ups of numbers:

- Bounding box = the full image (simple YOLO label)
- Then artificially place them on wheel-like images (or real wheel frames)
- Could simulate:
    - Rotations
    - Lighting variations
    - Blur
    - Occlusion
    - Wheel colour backgrounds
- This would create the **context YOLO needs**.

### Mentor’s Sample Code

He provided an example script (**stable_diffusion.txt**) that uses Stable Diffusion **inpainting** for polygon-based object synthesis.  
Not directly applicable to my use case (no inpainting needed), but useful for understanding:

- pipeline structure
- dataset creation flow
- YOLO label generation
- polygon → bounding box conversion

## 7. **Key Advice From Mentor**

- **Don't restrict yourself to one approach.**
- Try:
    - Template matching
    - YOLO with simple synthetic data
    - YOLO with contextual synthetic placements
    - OCR (optional)
    - Classical CV methods (morphology, edge-based detection)
- Dissertation should:
    - Compare different methods
    - Evaluate strengths/weaknesses
    - Show experimental reasoning
    - Highlight surprising results if found
