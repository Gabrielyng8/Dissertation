## 1. **Summary of Discussion**

This meeting focused on continuing the exploration of detection approaches, reviewing the improved template-matching results using the **‘0’ green pocket**, introducing improvements for stabilising detections, and discussing the parallel HSV segmentation pipeline and possible hybridisation of the two methods.

## 2. **Progress Presented by Student**

### **2.1 Improved Template Matching Using ‘0’ Pocket**

- Last week I had explained the template-matching scripts I wrote.
- This week I swapped the initial template from the **red ‘3’ pocket** to the **green ‘0’ pocket**.
- Because the ‘0’ pocket is:
    - the most visually distinct,
    - has a unique colour,
    - has higher contrast against neighbours,  
        I achieved **significantly better results**.
- I showed the supervisor the output video of the updated multi-template matching process.

## 3. **Supervisor Feedback & Recommendations**

### **3.1 Real-Time Rendering + Stabilised Detections**

- Modify the **main loop** to render the video **in real time**, not only after processing.
- Implement a **double-ended queue (deque)**–based stabilisation system:
    - Maintain a queue of length **3**.
    - Push **1** for a positive detection only when the match distance is within threshold.
    - Push **0** otherwise.
    - Render the bounding box _only_ if the queue becomes:  
        **`[1, 1, 1]`**  
        (reduces flickering and sporadic false positives).
- He emphasised:
    > “It is better to skip detections than show incorrect detections.”

### **3.2 HSV Colour Segmentation Approach**

- I showed him the quick prototype script detecting the green pocket via HSV segmentation.
- Supervisor recommended applying image **pre-processing**, especially:
    - **Normalisation**
    - **Histogram equalisation**
- These should greatly improve segmentation robustness under varying lighting.

### **3.3 Combining Template Matching + HSV Segmentation**

Supervisor noted that I now have **two semi-working systems**, each useful in different ways.  
He recommended exploring a **hybrid approach**, for example:

- **Scoring system** combining template-match score + segmentation confidence.
- **Cross-checking logic**:
    - e.g., segmentation centroid falls _within or near_ the template-matched bounding box.
- **Fallback logic**:
    - If template matching fails (queue = 0), use HSV segmentation for that frame.
- **Queue blending**:
    - Use the double-ended queue idea where segmentation can “back up” template matching.

This encourages robustness in different lighting & wheel conditions.

---
### **3.4 Fix Template Definition**

- Currently, templates are centred on the **digit ‘0’**.
- Supervisor suggested:  
    **I should instead centre templates on the area where the ball will land**,  
    which is the green pocket region, not only the digit.
- This will make the templates more generalisable and context-agnostic.

---
### **3.5 Supervisor’s Intuition**

- His “gut feeling” is that **HSV segmentation may end up outperforming template matching**,  
    especially in challenging videos or changing environments.
- But continuing both in parallel is useful for comparison & experimentation.

---
### **3.6 User Calibration Feature**

- Suggested adding a **setup step** where the user selects the shade of green using a **slider**.
- This will improve robustness across:
    - different casinos,
    - different wheels,
    - different lighting conditions.

---
### **3.7 Viva Preparation**

Supervisor stressed that:

> “You must know your code **line by line** for the viva.”

This means being able to explain _why each section exists_, _what it does_, and _how changing parameters affects the outcome_.

---
### **3.8 Literature Review Direction**

- Supervisor advised beginning to **research academic work** on:
    - Colour-based segmentation
    - Template matching
    - Hybrid approaches
    - Object localisation in non-fixed environments
- He provided an **excellent past dissertation** to study:
    - Literature review structure
    - Writing style
    - Level of depth expected

This will help with shaping my own literature review and methodology chapter.
