### 🔍 Topics Discussed

- **Consumer Roulette Wheels**
    
    - Briefly discussed checking **Amazon** for suitable consumer-grade roulette wheels for experimental testing.
        
    - Emphasis on realism and accessibility rather than professional casino-grade equipment.
        
- **Template Matching Pipeline**
    
    - Agreed to **continue with the template matching approach**, given its strong recent results.
        
    - Performance considerations discussed:
        
        - Reduce the number of processed frames to improve runtime efficiency.
            
        - Avoid unnecessary per-frame computation where possible.
            
- **Ellipse Fitting Strategy**
    
    - Discussed fitting the ellipse using a **minimum number of detected points** rather than dense sampling.
        
    - This aims to:
        
        - Improve robustness.
            
        - Reduce computational overhead.
            
        - Maintain sufficient geometric accuracy.
            
- **Ellipse Manipulation**
    
    - Confirmed that **percentage-based scaling** should be used when manipulating ellipse dimensions (e.g. halo boundaries).
        
    - This ensures resolution-independent and camera-agnostic behaviour.
