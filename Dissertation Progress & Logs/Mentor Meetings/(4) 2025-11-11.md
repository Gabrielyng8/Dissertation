## ✅ Overview

This meeting focused heavily on clarifying which computer-vision approaches are worth pursuing first, how to structure the experimentation phase, and how to evaluate competing methods.

## 1. **Key Points Discussed**

- **Homography-based approach recommended**  
    Mentor believes homography will give the strongest, most reliable results for wheel geometry calibration.  
    YOLO-based number detection might not produce the best outcomes, especially with synthetic datasets.
    
- **Avoid creating unnecessary complexity at the start**  
    Advice:
    > “Do not create problems for yourself.”  
    > Begin with **simple, controlled conditions**, such as:
    - Bird’s-eye view
    - Minimal variables
    - Avoiding problematic angles or lighting at the early stage
    
- **Experimentation vs. following mentor recommendation**  
    I asked:  
    Even if the mentor prefers approach _X_, should I still explore others for dissertation value?  
    → Mentor confirmed **yes**, experimentation is essential for the project and write-up.
    
- **How to compare and choose the best approach?**  
    Mentor explained two categories:
    
    **If using a classifier (e.g., YOLO):**
    - Use built-in evaluation metrics:
        - Precision
        - Recall
        - F1-Score
        - mAP
    
    **If using a non-classifier approach (e.g., template matching, homography, segmentation):**
    
    - Use **Ground Truthing**
    - Collect **10–20 videos**
    - Manually create a **confusion matrix**
    - Compare detections vs. true observations
    
- **Instance segmentation suggestion**  
    YOLO can be used in _instance segmentation_ mode, not only bounding boxes.
    - Object Detection → bounding boxes
    - Image Segmentation → outlines the shape of object  
        Mentor said segmentation datasets may already exist on **Roboflow**, and creating my own is still feasible if needed.
    
- **Importance of personal research**  
    Mentor emphasized:
    > There may be simple approaches neither of us are aware of.  
    > My responsibility is to research widely and discover potential solutions.

## 2. **Action Items / Next Steps**

- Start with **homography experiments** using controlled, simple footage.
- Begin planning how to collect **ground-truth data**.
- Explore:
    - YOLO bounding-box vs instance-segmentation pipelines
    - Roboflow datasets for wheel/number segmentation
- Investigate alternative number-reading methods beyond YOLO.
- Continue surveying literature for simpler, under-the-radar methods.
