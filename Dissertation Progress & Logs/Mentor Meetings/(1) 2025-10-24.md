## 🧠 Discussion Overview

This was the **first formal meeting** with my mentor to discuss the direction and feasibility of my dissertation project.  
I began by walking him through the **main stages of my current plan**:

1. **Computer Vision (YOLO):** Detect and track the roulette ball’s position during each spin.
2. **Pocket Identification (Homography/OCR):** Determine which pocket the ball lands in.
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Use extracted outcomes to assess the wheel’s randomness and fairness.

## 💬 Mentor Feedback and Discussion Points

### 1. Reframe the Project as a _Calibration Tool_

- **Mentor’s Input:**  
    The SOI should be rephrased to focus on **calibration and verification**, not randomness detection.
    - Casinos already assume the wheel’s randomness by design and manufacturing standards.
    - My system should act as a **computer-vision calibration tool** that ensures the wheel _remains_ random through consistent mechanical performance.
    
- **My Takeaway:**  
    This change improves feasibility and gives the project a clear applied purpose.  
    → The project becomes _supportive and preventive_ (detecting misalignment or wear), not _reactive_ (proving bias).

### 2. Homography Approach Approved ✅

- **Mentor’s Input:**  
    He liked the **homography-based approach**, particularly the idea of using the **green “0” pocket** as a reference point and mapping all other pockets geometrically.
    - This eliminates the need for unreliable OCR under motion blur or curved text.
    - It aligns with the calibration focus — mapping precise geometry instead of reading text.
    
- **My Takeaway:**  
    I’ll **fully drop OCR** and describe the homography-based mapping as the project’s main novelty.  
    This becomes the system’s **core calibration mechanism**.

### 3. Synthetic Bias Injection Rejected ⚠️

- **Mentor’s Input:**  
    He was not in favour of _synthetic bias injection_ to simulate unfairness, as it could weaken the **validity** of results.
    - Instead, he recommended gathering **real, physical data** — ideally using a **non-professional roulette wheel** (Amazon or eBay) that I can record myself.
    - This makes the work more **hands-on, measurable, and credible**.
    
- **My Takeaway:**  
    Remove all mentions of artificially biased data.  
    Focus on **real-world calibration accuracy**, comparing detected vs. expected pocket positions.

### 4. Literature on Wheel Manufacturing & Calibration 🧩

- **Mentor’s Input:**  
    The roulette wheel industry is highly regulated and manufacturing precision is already rigorous.
    - To justify the _research gap_, I must study and cite **existing wheel manufacturing and calibration practices**.
    - The goal is to explain _why_ computer vision could complement or enhance those traditional mechanical methods (e.g., precision measurement, early misalignment detection, automation).
    
- **My Takeaway:**  
    Add a new literature subsection titled:
    > “Manufacturing Precision and Calibration Standards of Physical Roulette Wheels”  
    > and contrast it with **automated computer vision-based calibration**.

### 5. Practical Note on Computer Vision Difficulty

- **Mentor’s Comment:**  
    “If a human struggles to do it, a computer will likely struggle too.”
    - Meaning: CV tasks should focus on things that are **objective and measurable** (e.g., geometry, motion, angles) — not tasks humans already find ambiguous (like reading blurred text).
        
- **My Takeaway:**  
    Strengthens the decision to avoid OCR.  
    Focus on **geometric precision, angular mapping, and measurable calibration outputs**.

### 6. Patent Discovery: [[US20200211327A1.pdf#page | US 20200211327 A1 (Evolution Malta Ltd) ]]📄

- **Mentor’s Concern:**  
    He found a patent describing a **roulette wheel bias tracking system** using camera-based monitoring, which appears similar in principle.

- **My Response / Clarification:**
    - The patent focuses on **real-time bias detection in live casinos**, not academic calibration or open-source research.
    - My dissertation’s purpose is **non-commercial** — a **prototype feasibility study** to demonstrate how CV can aid wheel calibration.
    - Legally, patents only restrict _commercial exploitation_, not _academic research_.
    - Academically, I will reference the patent as evidence of **industry interest** and clearly highlight my **distinct research gap**:
        > An open, low-cost, homography-based calibration tool for roulette wheel consistency verification.

## 🧱 Agreed Next Steps

|#|Action|Description|
|---|---|---|
|1|**Rephrase SOI**|Frame the project as a _calibration and verification system_ rather than fairness assessment.|
|2|**Refine Literature Review**|Add section on roulette wheel manufacturing and calibration standards.|
|3|**Adopt Homography**|Fully commit to geometric calibration using the green “0” as reference. Drop OCR.|
|4|**Remove Synthetic Bias**|Replace with real-world recorded data using a physical roulette wheel.|
|5|**Add Industry Context**|Acknowledge the Evolution Malta patent in the literature and clarify how the project differs.|
|6|**Plan Prototype Testing**|Obtain a small roulette wheel for controlled data collection and calibration experiments.|

## 🧩 Overall Reflection

This meeting clarified the project’s **new identity**:

> A _Computer Vision Calibration System_ that verifies the mechanical and geometric consistency of roulette wheels using homography-based mapping and real-world video data.

This new framing improves:

- **Feasibility** (hands-on and measurable)
- **Validity** (no artificial data)
- **Research depth** (clear industrial context)
- **Academic defensibility** (distinct from patented work)

## 🗣️ Next Meeting Talking Points

In preparation for the next mentor meeting, I plan to cover the following topics and confirm next actions:

- **Patent Discussion:**  
  Present and discuss the findings from [[US20200211327A1 Findings]], emphasizing how my project remains academically distinct and non-commercial.

- **Synthetic Bias vs Real Data Approach:**  
  Summarize the insights from [[Synthetic Bias Injection]], explaining how the system will use public videos for CV validation, optional simulated bias for algorithm sensitivity, and real physical data from a purchased roulette wheel for experimental calibration.
