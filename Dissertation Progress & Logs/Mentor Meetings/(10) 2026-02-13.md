### 1️⃣ Literature Review – Structure Over Volume

The supervisor emphasised that **content quality depends more on structure and argument-building than raw content volume**.

- As long as all claims are properly cited, the content itself is unlikely to be problematic.
    
- The key risk lies in:
    
    - Weak structural flow
        
    - Poor argument progression
        
    - Sections that describe rather than synthesise
        
- The literature review must demonstrate:
    
    - Logical development of ideas
        
    - Critical comparison between studies
        
    - Clear positioning of the research gap
        

He reiterated that **how I construct the argument is more important than simply what I include**.

### 2️⃣ Citations & Generic Statements

- Avoid standalone generic claims.
    
- Strong statements should ideally be supported by **multiple sources** (e.g., [1,2] or [2,3,4]).
    
- Particularly when:
    
    - Describing general trends
        
    - Making methodological claims
        
    - Discussing robustness, bias, or regulatory practice
        

The goal is to reinforce credibility through cross-validation of sources.

### 3️⃣ Word Count Concerns

- If I exceed 4,000 words, I must reduce lengthy descriptive passages.
    
- Large explanatory blocks (especially in early sections like Chapter 2) should be tightened.
    
- However, I **should not worry excessively about total word count at this stage**.
    
- Word count optimisation will be addressed in May.

### 4️⃣ Required Diagrams

The supervisor stressed that diagrams are essential:

- Include diagrams from cited academic papers (properly referenced).
    
- A **technical diagram from a patent** would significantly strengthen the perceived seriousness and engineering depth of the project.
    
    - He is expecting at least one such diagram.
        
    - This would help demonstrate industrial relevance and technical grounding.

### 5️⃣ Section 2.7 Introduction

- The introduction to Section 2.7 requires a citation.
    
- Even introductory framing statements must be referenced.

### 6️⃣ Similar Study on Roulette Bias

I mentioned that I cited a study where a roulette wheel bias was analysed, but outcomes were recorded manually rather than via computer vision.

Supervisor feedback:

- This study is highly relevant.
    
- I should expand the discussion significantly.
    
- Possibly create a dedicated subsection analysing:
    
    - Methodology used
        
    - Data collection process
        
    - Limitations (manual recording vs automated vision-based system)
        
    - How my approach advances beyond it
        

This will strengthen my positioning and justification.

### 7️⃣ Technical Platform Requirement

- I must migrate my LaTeX dissertation project to MCAST’s official Overleaf platform:
    
    - **overleaf.mcast.edu.mt**
        
- This ensures compliance with institutional submission workflows.

### 8️⃣ Action Plan Before Next Meeting (23rd February)

By next meeting I should:

- ✅ Attempt to conclude the working prototype
    
- ✅ Implement requested literature review improvements:
    
    - Strengthen structure
        
    - Add missing citations
        
    - Expand similar roulette bias study
        
    - Insert diagrams (including patent diagram)
        
    - Refine large explanatory sections
