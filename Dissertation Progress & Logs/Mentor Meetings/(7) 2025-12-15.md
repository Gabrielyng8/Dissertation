### 1. Administrative & Research Workflow Notes

- Supervisor advised **not to be overly granular with literature review subtitles**, keeping the structure clear and readable.
- Recommendation to use **Zotero** for reference management:
    - Store references using **BibTeX**, in preparation for **Overleaf / LaTeX** final submission.
    - Use **Google Scholar** in combination with the **Zotero browser extension** for instant reference saving and consistent citation management.

### 2. Progress Demonstrated by Student

#### 2.1 Template Matching Results

- Student presented **very strong visual outputs** from the latest template matching implementation.
- Confirmed implementation of a **double-ended queue (deque)** to stabilise detections and suppress sporadic false positives.

#### 2.2 Template Variants Tested

Two different template strategies were evaluated:

1. **Digit-based template (centered on ‘0’):**
    - Achieved the **best and most stable results**.
    - Provided reliable localisation of the zero pocket.
2. **Pocket-based template (green landing area below ‘0’):**
    - Tested to directly obtain pocket coordinates and avoid additional processing.
    - Results were **unsuccessful and unstable**.

- Student hypothesised that the reduced performance is due to:
    - The implementation operating on **grayscale images**.
    - Full RGB template matching being more computationally expensive and not currently used.

### 3. Supervisor Feedback & Methodological Guidance

#### 3.1 Coordinate Derivation

- Supervisor clarified that detecting the **‘0’ digit coordinates is sufficient**.
- The actual pocket location can be obtained by applying a **fixed spatial offset**, making direct pocket detection unnecessary.

#### 3.2 Alternative Approaches Suggested

- **Hybrid approach**:
    - Slightly enlarge the template region.
    - Perform frame-by-frame cropping around the detected template.
    - Apply **colour segmentation** within the cropped region to isolate the green pocket area.
- **Geometric approach**:
    - Assume the roulette wheel centre is approximately at the screen centre.
    - Draw a line from the wheel centre to the detected ‘0’ digit.
    - The landing pocket lies along this radial line at a known distance.

---

### 4. Generalisation & Scalability

- Supervisor raised the question of **robustness across different wheels or scenarios**.
- Student explained that an **automatic template generator** has already been implemented, enabling fast adaptation to new wheels without manual intervention.

---

### 5. Live Stream Applicability

- Student asked whether template matching can be applied to a **live video stream**.
- Supervisor confirmed that this is feasible.

---

### 6. Performance Discussion

- Current performance metrics:
    - ~11 second video
    - ~76 templates
    - Processing time: **3–5 minutes**
    - Complexity explained as:  
        **time ≈ number of frames × number of templates**
- Supervisor suggestions:
    - `writer.write(frame)` may introduce heavy overhead:
        - Instead, **store processed frames in memory** and write them to disk at the end.
    - Avoid processing every frame:
        - Process **2–3 frames per second** rather than full-frame-rate analysis.

---

### 7. System-Level Strategy Discussion
- Student expressed concern about needing **continuous tracking of the ‘0’ pocket**.
- Supervisor clarified that:
    - Continuous tracking is unnecessary.
    - A **limited number of frames** is sufficient to determine wheel geometry.

#### Proposed High-Level Strategy (Agreed Understanding):
1. **Initial setup phase**:
    - Run template matching to detect the ‘0’ pocket.
    - Use this information to draw a **circular “halo”** representing all landing pockets.
2. **Operational phase**:
    - Run **ball tracking continuously** (likely using YOLO).
    - Monitor whether the ball remains inside the halo for a predefined duration.
3. **Settlement detection**:
    - When the ball remains stable within the halo:
        - Re-run template matching to locate ‘0’.
        - Infer the final landing pocket relative to the ‘0’ position.

### 8. Key Emphasis from Supervisor

- Priority should be on **solving the core problem correctly**.
- Performance optimisation should be addressed **only after the methodological approach is sound and validated**.
