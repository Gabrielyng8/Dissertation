### 🔬 Technical Progress Update

- Presented results of **template-matching based ellipse fitting** as an alternative to traditional **edge and contour detection**.
    
- Achieved **good and stable results**, particularly in controlled frame conditions.
    
- Ellipse fitting using template localisation proved more consistent than edge-based approaches, especially under minor lighting variation.
    
- Discussed next development milestone:
    
    - Begin implementation of **YOLO-based object detection** for ball tracking.
        
    - Start transitioning focus toward **formal dissertation writing** alongside development.

### 🏗 Architectural Refinement (Supervisor Suggestion)

Supervisor recommended restructuring the system into two distinct operational modes:

#### 1️⃣ Setup Mode

- Responsible for:
    
    - Calculating and calibrating wheel geometry.
        
    - Extracting ellipse parameters.
        
    - Determining the “halo” region around the wheel.
        
- Outputs stable geometric reference data for runtime use.
    

#### 2️⃣ Running Mode

- Uses calibrated geometry from Setup Mode.
    
- Performs:
    
    - Ball tracking (future YOLO integration).
        
    - Detection of landing event using halo boundaries.
        
- Separates calibration logic from runtime detection logic.
    

This architectural separation improves:

- Code modularity
    
- Experimental reproducibility
    
- Conceptual clarity in the Methodology chapter
    
- Evaluation design (calibration vs tracking performance)

### 📚 Literature Review Feedback

Supervisor provided structural and academic writing feedback:

- Every **statement or claim** must clearly indicate its reference source.
    
- Strong or generalised claims should ideally be supported by **multiple references**, especially when:
    
    - Discussing computer vision robustness
        
    - Claiming performance advantages
        
    - Describing statistical or regulatory standards
        
- Avoid unsupported generalisations.
