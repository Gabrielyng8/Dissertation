## 🧾 What the patent actually covers

The Evolution Malta Ltd. patent (US 20200211327 A1) describes:

- A **camera-based system** that watches the roulette wheel in real time.
- It detects when the **ball crosses specific “imaginary circles”** (drop zones) near the deflectors and rotor.
- It logs those positions to a database to look for **drop-zone bias** (early detection of physical faults).
- It’s an **industrial online-casino monitoring tool** for continuous bias detection.

So their claims are basically: _“Using camera vision to track the ball crossing certain circular zones and storing those positions to detect bias.”_

## ⚙️ How your project differs

|Aspect|The Patent|Your Dissertation|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Commercial _bias-tracking_ and maintenance of live casino wheels|**Calibration and verification tool** for ensuring wheel geometry and fairness alignment|
|**Implementation scope**|Proprietary, continuous monitoring integrated into live casino servers|**Research prototype**, using publicly available or self-recorded footage|
|**Data usage**|Real-time drop-zone statistics over thousands of live spins|Controlled dataset for calibration validation (geometric consistency, wheel mapping)|
|**Approach**|Detects ball crossing multiple “imaginary circles”|Uses **homography from the green “0” pocket** for geometric calibration and mapping|
|**Focus**|Detecting early mechanical faults via drop-zone bias alerts|Validating whether a **vision-based calibration method** can replace manual/physical alignment checks|
|**Novelty**|Industrial bias-alert pipeline|**Academic exploration** of computer-vision calibration accuracy and reproducibility|

In short: the patent implements _what a casino would deploy_; you’re building _a research prototype_ to test whether CV calibration can **replicate or assist** those checks.

## ⚖️ What this means legally and academically

- **Legally:**
    - Patents restrict _commercial use_ of the patented method, not academic research.
    - You’re safe as long as you’re not selling or distributing a competing product.
    
- **Academically:**
    - You must **acknowledge it in your literature review** as existing work (e.g., “Industry patents such as US 20200211327 A1 demonstrate commercial interest in camera-based bias tracking; however, they do not address open, low-cost calibration approaches using consumer-grade vision systems.”).
    - Then clearly show your **research gap**: your tool focuses on _open, reproducible calibration_ rather than closed, proprietary monitoring.

## ✅ How to position this in your SOI

Here’s how you can phrase it:

> “Existing industrial patents (e.g., Evolution Malta Ltd, 2020) propose closed-source camera systems for bias detection in online roulette wheels. These focus on continuous monitoring of commercial wheels using dedicated infrastructure. By contrast, this study explores an open, computer-vision-based calibration approach using homography and geometric mapping to evaluate wheel alignment and pocket consistency under accessible experimental conditions. This supports fairness assurance and mechanical validation without relying on proprietary systems.”

That shows you’re _aware_ of the state of the art, not competing with it.

## 🔒 TL;DR

- ❌ It does _not_ invalidate your project.
- ✅ It actually strengthens your **literature gap** and **impact justification** — there’s real industry demand for this.
- ✅ You just need to reference it and clarify that your goal is **academic calibration and validation**, not **commercial bias-detection automation**.
