Concluded SOI refinement, paying attention to the new purpose of the study which focuses on easy monitoring of game-wheel physics and not restricted to professional wheel.

Synthetic Dataset:

Go and research hwow best to have a dataset of small tiles and have a model detect them as part of a larger image (in context)

stable diff. 2 to create a yolo dataset (images + labels)

This is a template matching problem (finding the numbers by themselves) could replace yolo
